# Weekend Project 5: 
1. Actually, my code is only shows the first step of the requirements. However, I will explain more about what I did below:   
  1.1. Create a variable for the container.  
  1.2. Generate the HTML and put it in the DOM.  
  1.3. Added the eventListener to generate button.
  1.4. After that, I started to build the modal in order to reach the detail.  
  1.5. Using the openModal function to get the new element and create another HTML for the new card.
  1.6. Added the event Delegation to the 
2. The requirements were undestandable but the way how to work them out was hard to me so it is only the first step which works. I tried the second step and gave me an error.
3. If I had more time, I would look for another solution to solve the second step and make the code more cleaner as well.  
  3.1. There are some bugs in there:  
  3.1.1. Firstly, the image does not show so it gives an error in the console.  
  3.1.2. Secondly, there is an error which says that it cannot read property "forEach" of null.   
So, that's all about my code. Thank you and happy reading!
